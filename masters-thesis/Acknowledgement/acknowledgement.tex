I would like to acknowledge first and foremost my two supervisors, Marton Havasi
and Dr Jos\'e Miguel Hern\'andez-Lobato. They both have been extremely supportive
and resourceful during the completion of this project, and I have been greatly
inspired by their enthusiasm and seemingly endless pool of ideas.

I would also like to thank Ferenc Husz\'ar for providing invaluable early
guidance, which has greatly facilitated finding the right direction for our
project and applying the correct methods in the design of our models and
experiments.

Finally, I would like to thank Stratis Markou, Joshua Kramer and Nick Tikhonov
for being the amazing friends they were to me during the whole year and who have
helped me get through the many challenging periods of this MPhil. I spent a very
enjoyable and intellectually stimulating year in their company.
