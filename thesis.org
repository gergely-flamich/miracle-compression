** DONE Implement (basic) rejection sampling
   CLOSED: [2019-05-19 Sun 14:20]

** TODO Implement block-basid RS?

** TODO Upscale stuff


* Questions [0/3]
** TODO What is the appropriate way to train the network?
   - In [[file:papers/clic2018_winner.pdf][clic winner]] and [[file:papers/var_comp_with_hyperprior.pdf][Balle 2018]] they suggest downloading stuff from Flickr and using 256x256 cutouts
** TODO How to make the network work for arbitrary image sizes?
   Would a purely CNN + ResNet based architecture work?
** TODO Is -PSNR + KL the appropriate loss to use?
   - Criticised in [[file:papers/nn_img_loss_fns.pdf][here]]
   
* Ideas
** Denoising VAEs -> compress similar images to the same latent representation?
